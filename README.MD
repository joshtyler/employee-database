#employee-database

A simple database program written in C to store, retrieve and sort employee details.

This program was created as part of an introduction to C class. The three versions of the program behave differently, with TYLERJ-employee3.c being the more advanced.

## Notes

The program uses tabs/spaces in a strange way, so will look odd with a tab width different to two.
